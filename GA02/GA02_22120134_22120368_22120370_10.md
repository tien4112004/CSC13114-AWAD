## Seminar Proposal

### 1. Seminar Title

‚ÄúAccelerating Web Application Development with Spec-Driven Development and Spec Kit‚Äù

### 2. Introduction / Background

In modern web application development, teams face pressure to deliver high-quality features rapidly while maintaining architecture consistency, proper testing, and alignment between product vision and implementation.

With the rise of AI-assisted coding tools, developers now have powerful aids to help generate code snippets, boilerplate, and even complex logic. However, integrating these tools into a coherent development workflow remains a challenge. If not managed well, the use of AI coding agents can lead to fragmented codebases, misaligned implementations, and increased technical debt.

The emerging paradigm of _Spec-Driven Development (SDD)_ flips the traditional workflow by making specifications the primary artifact and enabling tools (such as Spec Kit) to translate those specs ‚Äî often with AI assistance ‚Äî into working implementations. The approach offers potential gains in aligning product intent, reducing misinterpretation, and speeding up feature delivery in a web-stack context. ([GitHub Documentation][1])

### 3. Objectives:

By the end of this seminar, participants will be able to:

1. Explain the architecture and philosophy of Spec-Driven Development and how Spec Kit supports it.
2. Demonstrate how a web application feature (frontend + backend) can be scaffolded using Spec Kit‚Äôs workflow.
3. Critically compare the benefits and limitations of Spec-Driven Development in real-world web dev teams.
4. Identify scenarios where Spec-Driven Development is most applicable, and where traditional workflows may still be preferred.

### 4. Scope and Relevance:

- This seminar will focus on the SDD workflow in the context of **modern web applications**: frontend (e.g., React/Vue/Svelte) + API/backend + database.
- We‚Äôll cover how Spec Kit integrates with AI coding agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude), and review how the spec ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí implementation phases work.
- The discussion will include practical considerations such as when SDD is appropriate (greenfield vs. legacy), how it interacts with agile workflows, and how web-dev teams could adopt or resist it.
- It does **_not_** aim to deeply cover the internals of every supported AI agent, nor will it provide exhaustive code walkthroughs of a large system‚Äîrather, we‚Äôll use a representative web-feature to illustrate the workflow.

### 5. Expected Outcomes

Participants will leave with:

- A clear understanding of the concept of Spec-Driven Development (SDD) and its role in modern web development workflows.
- Knowledge of how SDD aligns product intent with implementation to reduce misinterpretation and technical debt.
- An understanding of how SDD integrates with AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot to enhance productivity.
- Practical insights into using Spec Kit to scaffold a web application feature, including both frontend and backend components.
- The ability to identify the strengths and limitations of SDD in comparison to traditional development workflows. Participants should able to determine which scenarios SDD should be applied to.
